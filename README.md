## 🙋‍♂️ About me
My coding journey started when I joined the [**42 Tokyo**](https://42tokyo.jp/) Piscine in Aug 2024! With absoloutly no coding experience beyond Scratch, it was definetly a hard month taking 2h long trains daily just to get to campus and grinding all day, but it was also very exciting!

Just like the recent change of the 42 slogan, and after fighting the beloved [norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette) for over a year, I’m looking forward to continuing learning from the 42 network and applying my new skills to projects!

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- [42 CPP_Module_01](https://github.com/yuknakas/CPP_Module01)
- More to confirm in the next Semester!

## ⚡ Fun Projects!
- [42 Minishell](https://github.com/yuknakas/minishell): Coding a simple bash shell... but is it really simple?? Understanding bash syntax and connecting it to C coding; very difficult, but even more rewarding!
- [42 Philosophers](https://github.com/yuknakas/philo): Simulating philosophers taking turns eating from a bowl in the middle! Multithreading vs Multiprocessing and how to handle race conditions!
- [42 Frac-tol](https://github.com/yuknakas/fract-ol): Visualizing a fractol! Mandelbrot, Julia, and Burningship; how do fractols work and how to visualize the infinite calculations!?
- [42 Push_swap](https://github.com/yuknakas/push_swap): A restricted sorting algorithim using only two stacks and 9 commands. And as a bonus, I've made a chacker for it (works better than the sorting code to be honest...)!
- [RA Bootcamp 2025](https://github.com/yuknakas/BLP_replication): Replication of the BLP method from the study of economics. My first interaction with Stat Analysis and R!

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Currently learning CPP and how object based languages work! It's particually interesting to see how some diffcult implementations in C can be so easy using objects, and how they work!
I'm also a student at Whitman College! I haven't declared my major yet but my interests + classes are...
- CS: Took **System Programing** (understanding how systems work + assembly) → now heading to **Software Development** w/ *Java*!
- Chem: Currently taking the Orgo (Organic Chemistry) process → will continue to nex semster
- Digital Imaging and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) Alliance 2026 → Combining CS and Chem, my two big interests!
- Stats for Econ!
